### Hi there, I'm [Cong Son][website]😎

## About Me
As soon as I discovered that technology has impacted our society tremendously, I knew this had to be my career, so I decided to pursue a major in Computer Science. When taking Software Development Using Java at my Community College, I was inspired and fell in love with every single line of code. In September 2020, I took a data structure and algorithm class, and I added that hands-on class to my full-time schedule while I was learning web development.

Since I started studying Computer Science, I built multiple projects using different languages and libraries. One of the projects that I am very proud of is my Path Finding Visualizer where I learned and used a variety of data structures and algorithms.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything 🤣
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with others to build projects
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Actively looking for a software engineer internship opportunity for Summer 2021
